## To Use Babel
From within the app folder, type in terminal:

```
babel src/app.js --out-file public/scripts/app.js --presets=env,react --watch
```

src/app.js is the written code. 
public/scripts/app.js is the code transpiled to work on older browsers.

## To Run Live-Server
In a second terminal, serve up the public folder with:

```
live-server public
```

A localhost site should open and will also print in the console.# Expensify_App-Complete_React_Developers_Course
